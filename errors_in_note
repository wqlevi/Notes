# Logging frequent problem and solutions

## Linux wise
- [x] "libtinfo.so.6 has no version information", commonly it's suggested to `conda install conda-forge::ncurses`, but this messes up `vifm` who looks for system ncurses in `/usr/lib/x86_.../libtinfo.so.xx`;
  * simply don't hard code `LD_LIBRARAY_PATH` to some conda env, where a different `libtinfo` is installed;


## Python config (version conflicts)
- [x] JAX does not find GPU, which PyTorch find;
  * Usually CUDA-xx not matching, considering upgrade JAX in accordance to CUDA version
