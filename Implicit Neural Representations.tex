    \section{Introduction to INR}
    Unlike commen ways of expressing signals as discrete signal, such as images in grids with corresponding intensity values assigned to each grid, INR paramterize a signal as a continuous function that maps the domain of signal to the value in its coordinate. Of course, the function is not usually analytically tractable, thus INR approximate the function via a neural network. Namely, they are not coupled to spatial resolution of signal anymore, which facilitate the sampling signal at arbitrary resolution.
