\textbf{generalization:} The ability to perform well on previously unseen data is called generalization. That is, test error reflects generalization ability.\\
\textbf{underfitting:} When the model is not able to obtain a sufficient low training error;\\
\textbf{overfitting:} When the difference between \textit{test error} and \textit{training error} is too large;\\
